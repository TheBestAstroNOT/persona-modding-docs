## Introduction

Music addition (new songs not replacing any existing songs) is possible for the PC releases of P3P, P4G, and P5R using the [BGME Framework](https://gamebanana.com/mods/477399). To add new music, this mod must be downloaded and set as a dependency for your mod.

## Adding New Music

There are two main ways to add new music in Persona games.

* [Phos Music Manager](https://github.com/T-PoseRatkechi/phos-music-manager/releases) is a music manager designed to simplify music replacement or addition in Persona 3 Portable (PC), Persona 4 Golden (PC x64), and Persona 5 Royal (PC). It automatically handles all steps needed to encode and export music.
* If you would rather manually add new music files, [AtomEncd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jx9NBu40XUcJb0U4MdsVjPV84UTzWcpy/view) should be used instead.

## Using New Music

New music can be used right away in [events](../events/events.mdx) and [flowscript](../flowscript/flowscript.mdx) by calling their IDs. To change battle music using BGME, follow [the guide here](./battle-music.mdx).
